## Start Developing your Project

### Set up your project on GitHub  

To continuously build and deploy your application, we recommend using GitHub as described [here](README-GitHub.md).

### Package Structure
To organize our code we recommend the following package structure:

``` 
(io.jexxa.commons)
    plugins
    |    <technology 1>
    |    ...
    |    <technology n>
    dto  
    |    <use case 1>
    |    ...
    |    <use case n>
    ESPAdapters.java
```

### Cleanup Readme
